    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute (VCCRI) is renowned for the quality of its [scientific discoveries](https://www.victorchang.edu.au/heart-research/major-discoveries) and is dedicated to finding cures for cardiovascular disease through world-class and cutting-edge [medical research](https://www.victorchang.edu.au/heart-research).\r\nDSS have worked with VCCRI to develop a PoC to demonstrate the operational and economic benefit of the Filecoin Network and subsequently make this application on their behalf to solve a long-term data storage requirement resulting from their research.\r\nVCCRI are seeking to store their dataset as an archive on the Filecoin Network.\r\nDSS is a leading decentralised cloud storage provider dedicated to the Filecoin network based in Sydney. DSS operate enterprise scale compute and storage infrastructure in Tier 3 data centres throughout Australia with clients spanning the globe.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "Yes",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The data sets are the original outputs of scientific cardiac research.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Singularity v2",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "DSS do not currently have permission from the client to share the data publicly, although it has the full cooperation from the client to verify data with allocator directly.",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[ ] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "Permanently",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Australia (continent)",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01319368 - Australia\r\nf01938357 - Australia",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
